<p class="about">
The Student Strings Association of Peking University (SAPU) is a leading student organization that brings together musicians and enthusiasts across campus. SAPU provides a platform for outstanding string, wind, brass, and percussion players to collaborate; offers foundational courses for beginners; and fosters partnerships with external organizations. Since its founding, SAPU has been recognized repeatedly as an “Outstanding Student Association” at Peking University and maintains strong visibility both on campus and beyond.

The Symphony Orchestra was formed based on SAPU’s Performance Department and actively recruits accomplished string, wind, brass, and percussion players from both inside and outside the university. The ensemble welcomes musicians with established performance skills and typically maintains a roster of about 50 members each academic year.

Since its inception, the orchestra has embraced openness, artistic excellence, and exploratory spirit—bringing like-minded musicians together to pursue higher artistic standards, new concert formats, and diverse musical styles—while promoting classical music on and off campus.

The orchestra is currently led by conductor **Zhikai Wu**. It performs regularly at SAPU’s annual concerts and operates on a mature “audition–rehearsal–performance” cycle that emphasizes musical detail and continuous growth, presenting high-quality programs year after year.
